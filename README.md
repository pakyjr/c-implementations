# C Implementations

This repository contains various C programming projects. I am actively adding new projects, so check back for updates!

## Folder Overview

- **bst_c/**  
  Implementation of a simple binary search tree (BST) in C. Includes an example for inserting nodes and printing them in sorted order.

- **hashtable/**  
  Contains a basic hash table implementation using open addressing and linear probing. Includes header and source files for creating, setting, getting, and iterating over hash table entries.

- **sum_c/**  
  Demonstrates a simple program that calculates the sum of even and odd numbers from 1 to 100. The spicy part is that instead of the modulo operator we can do this using the bitwise & operation! If for some reason somebody asks you this in an interview, you can flex a bit. 

## More projects coming soon!
